With $N_{x}$ as the number of neurons in layer $x$, we have:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is not exactly the case for the Kaiming uniform distribution (which has variance $\\frac{12}{(2 \\sqrt{N_x})^2} = \\frac{3}{N_x}$), and as far as I'm aware there's no principled reason why PyTorch does this. But the most important thing is that the variance scales as $O(1 / N_x)$, rather than what the exact scaling constant is.\n",

    "\n",
    "One last thing to discuss before we move onto training our model: **GPUs**. We'll discuss this in more detail in later exercises. For now, [this page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/common-ml-errors/reports/How-To-Use-GPU-with-PyTorch---VmlldzozMzAxMDk) should provide a basic overview of how to use your GPU. A few things to be aware of here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `to` method is really useful here - it can move objects between different devices (i.e. CPU and GPU) _as well as_ changing a tensor's datatype.\n",
    "  - Note that `to` is never inplace for tensors (i.e. you have to call `x = x.to(device)`), but when working with models, calling `model = model.to(device)` or `model.to(device)` are both perfectly valid.\n",
    "- Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:\n",
    "  - Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device\n",
    "  - Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.\n",
    "  - Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common practice to put a line like this at the top of your file, defining a global variable which you can use in subsequent modules and functions (excluding the print statement):\n"

    "The batch size is the number of samples in each batch (i.e. the number of samples we feed into the model at once). While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get our training set, via the helper function `get_mnist`. This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define our optimizer, using `torch.optim.Adam`. The `torch.optim` module gives a wide variety of modules, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

    "Lastly, we have the actual training loop. We iterate through our training data, and for each batch we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate our model on the batch of data, to get the logits for our class predictions,\n",
    "2. Calculate the loss between our logits and the true class labels,\n",

    "  - Note you could also use the decorator `@t.inference_mode()` to do this, if your training loop was a function.\n",

    "Now, we'll implement our `BatchNorm2d`, the layer described in the documents you hopefully read above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something which might have occurred to you as you read about batch norm - how does it work when in inference mode? It makes sense to normalize over a batch of multiple input data, but normalizing over a single datapoint doesn't make any sense! This is why we have to introduce a new PyTorch concept: **buffers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `nn.Parameter`, a buffer is not its own type and does not wrap a `Tensor`. A buffer is just a regular `Tensor` on which you've called [self.register_buffer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.register_buffer) from inside a `nn.Module`. As an example, `self.register_buffer(\"variable_name\", t.zeros(10))` will define an object `self.variable_name` and register it as a buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a buffer, and why is it different to a standard attribute or to a `nn.Parameter` object? The differences are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is normally included in the output of `module.state_dict()`, meaning that `torch.save` and `torch.load` will serialize and deserialize it.\n",
    "- It is moved between devices when you call `model.to(device)`.\n",
    "- It is not included in `module.parameters`, so optimizers won't see or modify it. Instead, your module will modify it as appropriate within `forward`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation note: when defining BatchNorm2d, register_buffer lines must be **in order** and **after** initializing self.weight and self.bias (as the `copy_weights` function relies on order matching exactly).\n"

I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details.

    "\n",
    "Firstly, some explanation of `conv1d` in PyTorch. The `1` in `1d` here refers to the number of dimensions along which we slide the weights (also called the kernel) when we convolve. Importantly, it does not refer to the number of dimensions of the tensors that are being used in our calculations. Typically the input and kernel are both 3D:\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `kernel_width` dimension of the kernel slides along the `width` dimension of the input. The `output_width` of the output is determined by the number of kernels that can be fit inside it; the formula can be seen in the right part of the sketch.\n",
    "- For each possible position of the kernel inside the model (i.e. each freezeframe position in the sketch), the operation happening is as follows:\n",
    "  - We take the product of the kernel values with the corresponding input values, and then take the sum\n",
    "  - This gives us a single value for each output channel\n",
    "  - These values are then passed into the output tensor\n",
    "- The sketch assumes a batch size of 1. To generalise to a larger batch number, we can just imagine this operation being repeated identically on every input.\n",

    "\n",
    "This number isn't tied to the input image's channels but is a design choice in the neural network architecture. Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features. Additionally, this parameter is sometimes chosen based on the heuristic of wanting to balance the parameter count / compute for each layer - which is why you often see `out_channels` growing as the size of each feature map gets smaller.\n"

    "**Finetuning** can mean slightly different things in different contexts, but broadly speaking it means using the weights of an already trained network as the starting values for training a new network. Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.\n",

We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features.\n",

    "_Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term \"feature extraction\" rather than \"finetuning\"._\n",

When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",
